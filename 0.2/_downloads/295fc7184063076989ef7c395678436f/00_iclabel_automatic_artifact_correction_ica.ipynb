Because ICA can be computationally\nintense, we'll also crop the data to 60 seconds; and to save ourselves from\nrepeatedly typing ``mne.preprocessing`` we'll directly import a few functions\nand classes from that submodule.\n"

        "## Filtering to remove slow drifts\n\nBefore we run the ICA, an important step is filtering the data to remove\nlow-frequency drifts, which can negatively affect the quality of the ICA fit.\nThe slow drifts are problematic because they reduce the independence of the\nassumed-to-be-independent sources (e.g., during a slow upward drift, the\nneural, heartbeat, blink, and other muscular sources will all tend to have\nhigher values), making it harder for the algorithm to find an accurate\nsolution. A high-pass filter with 1 Hz cutoff frequency is recommended.\nHowever, because filtering is a linear operation, the ICA solution found from\nthe filtered signal can be applied to the unfiltered signal (see\n:footcite:`WinklerEtAl2015` for\nmore information), so we'll keep a copy of the unfiltered\n`~mne.io.Raw` object around so we can apply the ICA solution to it\nlater.\n\n"

        "## Fitting and plotting the ICA solution\n\n.. sidebar:: Ignoring the time domain\n\n    The ICA algorithms implemented in MNE-Python find patterns across\n    channels, but ignore the time domain. This means you can compute ICA on\n    discontinuous `~mne.Epochs` or `~mne.Evoked` objects (not\n    just continuous `~mne.io.Raw` objects), or only use every Nth\n    sample by passing the ``decim`` parameter to ``ICA.fit()``.\n\n    .. note:: `~mne.Epochs` used for fitting ICA should not be\n              baseline-corrected. Because cleaning the data via ICA may\n              introduce DC offsets, we suggest to baseline correct your data\n              **after** cleaning (and not before), should you require\n              baseline correction.\n\nNow we're ready to set up and fit the ICA. Since we know (from observing our\nraw data) that the EOG and ECG artifacts are fairly strong, we would expect\nthose artifacts to be captured in the first few dimensions of the PCA\ndecomposition that happens before the ICA. Therefore, we probably don't need\na huge number of components to do a good job of isolating our artifacts\n(though it is usually preferable to include more components for a more\naccurate solution). As a first guess, we'll run ICA with ``n_components=15``\n(use only the first 15 PCA components to compute the ICA decomposition) \u2014 a\nvery small number given that our data has over 300 channels, but with the\nadvantage that it will run quickly and we will able to tell easily whether it\nworked or not (because we already know what the EOG / ECG artifacts should\nlook like).\n\nICA fitting is not deterministic (e.g., the components may get a sign\nflip on different runs, or may not always be returned in the same order), so\nwe'll also specify a `random seed`_ so that we get identical results each\ntime this tutorial is built by our web servers.\n\n"
