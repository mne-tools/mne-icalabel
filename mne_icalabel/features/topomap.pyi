    """Generate an array of scalp topographies for the picked components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ica : ICA
    MNE `~mne.preprocessing.ICA` decomposition.
    picks : int | list of int | slice | None
    Indices of the independent components (ICs) to select.
    If an integer, represents the index of the IC to pick.
    Multiple ICs can be selected using a list of int or a slice.
    The indices are 0-indexed, so ``picks=1`` will pick the second IC: ``ICA001``.
    ``None`` (default) will pick all independent components in the order fitted.
    res : int
    The resolution of the square topographic map (in pixels).
    image_interp : str
    The image interpolation to be used. All matplotlib options are
    accepted.
    border : float | 'mean'
    Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
    then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.
    extrapolate : str
    Options:

    - ``'box'``
        Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
        data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
        of the data in the respective dimension.
    - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
        Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
        median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
        mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
    - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
        Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
        the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
        but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
        the head circle.

    Returns
    -------
    topomaps : dict of array of shape (n_components, n_pixels, n_pixels)
    Dictionary of ICs topographic maps for each channel type.
